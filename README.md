Canada welcomes approximately 225,000 immigrants annually, yet there is a noticeable absence of data regarding how immigration impacts housing prices within the nation. Our hypothesis is that housing prices increase as the amount of people immigrating to Canada increases. The null hypothesis, then, is that housing prices do not increase with the rise of people immigrating to Canada. 

Our analysis and conclusions:
It's essential to consider various factors when interpreting the relationship between immigration and housing prices. Here is a summary of our key points:

Consistency in Immigration and Housing Prices:
We've observed that there appears to be consistency in the rise of immigration and housing prices. This suggests a potential correlation between population growth due to immigration and the growth of the housing market.

T-Test Confirmation:
By conducting a t-test on both datasets, we've determined that there is no significant difference in the rise of each value count. This statistical analysis supports the idea that immigration and housing prices may be related, as there is no evidence of a significant divergence.

Additional Factors to Consider:
We must note that while immigration can impact the housing market, it's not the only factor at play. Consideration of interest rates, economic conditions, demographics, and government policies is crucial. These factors can influence housing demand and supply, affecting prices and market dynamics.

Limitations: In contrast to our hypothesis, the negative coefficient in the Machine Learning was an interesting find!

This analysis has given us a comprehensive understanding of the complexities involved in the housing market and the importance of taking a holistic approach to analysis. It's important to continue monitoring and researching these factors to make informed decisions regarding investments, housing policies, and economic planning.

Canada welcomes approximately 225,000 immigrants annually, yet there is a noticeable absence of data regarding how immigration impacts housing prices within the nation. Our hypothesis is that housing prices increase as the amount of people immigrating to Canada increases. The null hypothesis, then, is that housing prices do not increase with the rise of people immigrating to Canada.
